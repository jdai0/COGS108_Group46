In response to the growing demand for software development professionals, our research investigates the correlation between programming language proficiency and software engineer salaries in the U.S. We also explore how knowledge of multiple programming languages, especially popular ones like Python and Java, could potentially impact salary. Analyzing data in this field, we found a weak positive correlation between the number of languages known and median salary, similarly, the correlation between the popularity of languages and median salary is also weak. This research offers insights for job seekers, such as software professionals and students, to effectively understand the demands of the current software job market.
