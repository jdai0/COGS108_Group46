    "The COVID-19 pandemic has brought significant upheaval to various sectors in the United States, notably impacting industries like hospitality, travel, and retail. These sectors have faced considerable challenges, including job losses and reduced salaries 1. In contrast, the digital transformation accelerated by the pandemic has led to a surge in demand for software development professionals. This shift is driven by companies investing heavily in technology to adapt to new consumer behaviors, such as increased online shopping and remote working 2. According to CompTIA's February 2022 Tech Jobs Report, the average annual salary for an IT professional in the United States was $110,765 3. This has prompted many job seekers and university students to pivot or choose majors focused on software and programming, aiming for stable employment and income. \n",
    "However, a gap exists in the understanding of how proficiency in multiple programming languages influences employment opportunities and salary scales. While existing studies have largely focused on the demand for popular individual languages based on company needs 4, they often overlook the combined value of knowing multiple languages. \n",
    "Our research aims to bridge this gap by analyzing how the number of programming languages one is proficient in correlates with their salary progression in the software engineering field. Such insights are expected to provide valuable insights for individuals seeking to enhance their career prospects in this competitive job market.\n",

In addition, all of the programming languages were stored as a string together in one column rather than separately. Therefore we had to split the string into multiple columns and one hot encode the programming languages so it is easier to determine what languages every person knows. For preprocessing we found the total languages that every person knows by summing over all of the one hot encoded columns. This is because our analysis deals with the association between number of languages and salary so we needed to have those columns."

    "Based on our proposed data, there might be biases in terms of the work type, nationality(country), age, educational background, and coding activities. In terms of the wording, I do not think there are biases due to the author of the survey composing it into formulated options instead of free response type of questions. This eliminates the possibility of respondents being misguided by the wording of the terms. However, some variables are more likely to be inherently forcing on specific demographic groups, for instance, in terms of the nationality, people that are from countries(U.S., European nations, India.etc..) with a relatively stronger programming atmosphere and are more engaged with the western countries are more concentrated in this dataset, while people that are from other countries might be overlooked, and biased correlation might be established based on this issue. Moreover, in terms of educational background, people might not be willing to report their actual background due to stereotypical perspective of the society regarding this matter, meaning that people with relatively lower educational background might fabricate their answers when answering to this question. The same issue might also apply to salaries. People might exaggerate the numbers to achieve a better perceived social status, which is a tendency due to social perspective. In regard to privacy, there is no sensitive data on the dataset, and people were given the option to not answer specific questions if they do not feel comfortable, so privacy leak is not a concern. To detect the bias before the analysis, we would try to thoroughly understand the data by examining the demographics from the dataset(e.g. nationality) and computing descriptive statistics. During analysis, we would conduct exploratory data analysis to visualize the distribution of variables across the different demographic groups and plot different graphs such as histograms and box plots to identify disparities and outliers. Furthermore, we could apply statistical tests to identify the statistical differences between demographic groups(e.g. nationality). Lastly, when communicating the analysis, we would ensure to clearly document the sources of our data, the preprocessing actions taken, and the different methodologies used to address the biases identified. We would also convey the limitations of our analysis by acknowledging the presence of inherent biases to provide a comprehensive understanding of the results and their potential constraints in our final report.\n"

After the meeting ends, the team will communicate important details and receive progress updates from the missing team member through Discord as necessary.\n",

    "Task Distribution: We acknowledge that uneven task distribution is inevitable, but our group will try our best to ensure each member contributes equally throughout the entire project. We would achieve this by listing all the tasks to be completed for the week and sharing it accordingly. Since each member has different strengths and interests, we would open up the floor for each member to pick the tasks they desire, and discuss amongst ourselves if one task is selected by multiple members. We will try to get two people working on a single task when possible to help smoothen the workflow. \n",
